The plan from the Planner Agent is:
---
{plan_prompt}
---

Steps to perform:
1. Propose a broad search strategy using your available tools.
2. Execute that broad search (via tool calls) to see what data might exist.
3. Summarize findings and decide which data sources are most promising.
4. Narrow the search (again using your tools) to get more detailed data.
5. Finalize a list of relevant data sources to pass on to the Interpreter.
6. Output them in a structured format (e.g., JSON, bullet points, etc.).
